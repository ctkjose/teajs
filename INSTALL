Most of TeaJS docs are available online, see http://code.google.com/p/teajs/wiki/Manual. This file contains a somewhat obsolete archive version of the said page. 

= First steps =

In order to use TeaJS, you first have to get the binary. Windows users can just download a precompiled release [1], Ubuntu users can use a PPA [2]; otherwise one has to compile TeaJS from source. There is a separated wikipage dedicated to compiling TeaJS [3].

When you have a TeaJS working, you might need to setup the configuration file. It needs to be placed to a pre-defined location, which is set at compile time. If unsure, just run `tea` - it will tell you if the configuration file is not at the correct location.

You should check the configuration file and edit it if necessary. The most important value is `require.paths`, which corresponds to the directory in which TeaJS modules are located. *It is not possible to directly modify require.paths property; one must use array methods to modify its contents.*

*Windows users only:* TeaJS requires v8.dll to be present; additional TeaJS modules (most notably PostgreSQL) have more dll dependencies. These files are located in `dll/` subdirectory of Windows distribution, copy them either to system path or to TeaJS directory as necessary.

= Running =

== As a command-line program ==

Syntax (Linux/BSD/MacOS/Posix):
{{{
tea [-c configfile] [-d debugger_port] myscript.js
}}}

Syntax (Windows):
{{{
tea.exe [-c configfile] [-d debugger_port] myscript.js
}}}

If no `-c` option is specified, then the system-wide config file is used. The location for this file is set at compile time. If no system config file exists, TeaJS will refuse to run.

The `-d` options specifies a TCP port for the V8 debugger agent to listen at. If no `-d` option is specified, the debugger agent is disabled.

== As Apache module ==

This is described at separate page [4].
